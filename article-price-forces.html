              <p><a id="ch1" class="section scrollspy">Our</a> expensive healthcare system is increasingly mainstream. Experts list the dozen problems that drive costs and analyze each problem individually and suggest isolated solutions. We rush to a primitive urge to micromanage any variable that seems to give results, without consider the problem as a whole. We describe successful the British system that arduously controls physicians and insurance companies. But shifting our understanding of the problem can illuminate novel solutions. The forces that shape the most expensive health system in the world can be reduced to technological progress, nonexistent market competition, and misaligned incentives.</p>
              <h2>Technological Advancement</h2>

              <p>Technological innovation, like genetic sequencing, nano-scale treatment, and ultraprecise robotic surgeries, extend life, eliminate suffering, and prolong health. Technology is also expensive, and the more it is used, the less positive effects that we see from them. This is known as the Law of Diminishing Returns.</p>

              <p>The law of diminishing returns in medicine states that as medical treatment given to a patient increases, the benefits of each additional treatment decreases.8 In other words, cost aside, we can do too much of one thing.</p>

              <p>For example, consider breast cancer mammography screening. A study has shown that excessive mammography screening results in overdiagnosis of breast cancer, subjecting patients to often-harmful treatment of a tumor that would never have harmed the patient.9 54% of breast cancer detected from mammograms screening is estimated to be a result of overdiagnosis.10 </p>
              <p>Cesarean deliveries have also risen over the years, contributing to higher costs without increased beneficial returns. A recent study showed Cesarean Delivery should be kept at a rate between 19% as a population.6 The benefit appears to plateau around a rate of 20%. Today, approximately 33% of deliveries are C-Section, largely due to ease of technological use and higher defensive medicine (more on this shortly).7</p>
              <p>The rapid growth of treatment options has outpaced the ability to measure effectiveness, and is a major force contributing to the expense we face today. Some medical technological advancements have little value to patients, and get used far too often, like coronary artery stents12 and medical imaging. Amidst defensive medicine, we’ve often seen too much unnecessary use of resources.</p>

              <p>There’s an economic component to the use of too much of the wrong technology and the neglected development of productive technology. As we’ll explore, the healthcare market lacks the structural foundation to incentivize and promote a proper economic environment.</p>

              <h2>Improper Supply & Demand</h2>
              <h3>Inadequate Demand</h3>
              <p>Demand in healthcare is broken. Why? In economic terms, price elasticity barely exists. Price elasticity is how sensitive people are to prices. It’s the underlying premise behind demand. People choose what they purchase based on how much it costs, and how much they’re willing to pay for it. This is a subtle but monumental importance in why we don’t get what we want out of our healthcare market: people don’t choose their medical care with their wallets!</p>

              <p>The current insurance system eliminates the patient from the price negotiation. In economic sense, we are price INelastic with our medical care. As patients and medical consumers, we never directly see the cost of care and never truly choose our doctor or hospital based on their price. By imposing deductibles (a set amount patients pay first before insurance begins covering) and copayments (a fraction of the cost that patients must pay up-front), insurance companies and government coverage attempt to have people feel the direct economic burder of medical care. It’s not enough, however.</p>
              <h3>Incohesive cost structure</h3>
              <p>In our health market, the insurance company negotiates prices, no thte consumer. As a result, we see an ultimate insurer-provider struggle.This perpetual dance results in inflated prices, lacking price transparency, and elevated insurance costs. But how did this come to be? Let’s consider the struggle itself.</p>
              <p>In anticipation of a bargaining battle, medical providers charge insurers with the highest possible price for any given medical treatment. In many instances, the insurers do everything possible to avoid paying the providers. This causes bloated prices, and requires an unnecessarily large administrative department that handles the interaction with insurance companies.1 For example, a hospital may charge $128,714 for an eye surgery, but the insurance pays only $19,527. That’s an 85% discount! (Actual hospital bill Image, from David Belk MD).</p>
              <img src="" class="responsive-img" alt="hospital procedure bill">
              <p>The incentives for extremely high pricing are strong. Hospitals create disproportionately large coding and billing departments in attempts to stay above margin, in an increasingly concentrated insurance market. In hindsight, the incentives from this economic struggle are clear and are the invisible force in the biggest price challenges facing healthcare.</p>
              <h2>Misaligned Incentives</h2>
              <p>Economic incentives are the most powerful drivers for progress. They’re also the reason for the symptoms we’ve experienced in healthcare. Incentives in the health system are unique compared to most other markets. The doctor’s market power and defensive medicine are prime examples of misaligned incentives.</p>
              <h3>Physician’s Market Power</h3>
              <p>The government has been trying to mitigate and control the Doctor’s market power.14 Physician-Induced Demand, the power that the doctor (the supplier of medical care) to create more demand for his own product,15 is a political target. How is induced-demand possible? Information Asymmetry - The doctor’s medical expertise is difficult to challenge and compare quickly and easily. At any given doctor’s visit, he has the freedom to prescribe tests with equipment his practice owns, schedule follow-up visits, and explore long-term treatment options that may not create health value to the patient, but driven by economic incentives. We observe similar behavior with car mechanics and lawyers. The major distinction is that consumers pay for their services directly and can compare prices and quality relatively easily.</p>
              <p>Atul Gawande’s New Yorker article “The Cost Conundrum” explored the high cost outlier town of McAllen, Texas, and makes a connection with physician-induced demand and high cost. The data is highly debated, but worth a consideration. Studies have showed an income shock and reimbursement decrease to physicians result in small percentage increases in treatments.15 The fee-for-service (FFS) model of reimbursing doctors is a contributing factor in the incentive towards inducing demand.15</p>
              <h3>Defensive Medicine</h3>
              <p>The increasing frequency of malpractice suits against doctors has created a culture of treatment protocols that protect against malpractice suits. Surveys show that 91% of physicians practice defensive medicine.4 In 2003, US Department of health and Human Services estimated the cost of defensive medicine to be $60 billion per year, while In 2008, PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute estimated the figure to be at $210 billion per year.3</p>

              <h2>A Market Solution</h2>
              <p>It’s important to note that nobody orchestrated the system we have in place today. We’ve identified the major underlying causes of our fractured healthcare state. But as in Medicine, treating the underlying ailment, rather than treating the symptoms, is vital. Any progress must focus on the economic laws we observe everyday: Market regulation through price demand and supply.</p>
              <p>Regina Herzlinger, in Who Killed Healthcare?,16 explores free market solutions in healthcare. Private health insurance has inherent economic challenges (see Moral Hazard) that make it not a viable stand-alone solution to funding unexpected health expenses.Without political prejudice, consider the following. There are externalities in uninsured individuals: higher health cost to others as hospitals attempt to recuperate losses, higher insurance premiums with smaller financial reserve, and public health consequences of untreated diseases and unvaccinated populations. As in the case of car insurance, there must be a requirement to have health insurance, with the freedom to choose a company among a large list of insurance companies competing for it’s customers.</p>
              <p>You’re still reading? Good. Let’s consider what a free market healthcare environment may look like.</p>
              <p>Regina Herzlinger draws a system revolving around the fundamental principles of economic incentives and price demand from patients. 3 component drive her consumer-driven solutions: insurance packages, medical groups, and proper incentives.</p>

              <h3>Insurance Packages</h3>

              <p>She states that insurance packages could allocate a complete sum of money, $40,000 per year, for example, that can be used only towards medical care. Any money not used by individuals, could be partly rolled over to the next year to give lower monthly premiums, and partly reimbursed to the patient. Patient would suddenly become highly price-sensitive, and would undoubtedly shop for medical care the way they shop for tablets and restaurants.</p>

              <h3>Medical Teams</h3>
              <p>A second part of a market solution revolves around the medical team. Regina Herzinlinger examines independent company-like medical groups. One group type specializes in general care. The other group type specializes around medical conditions, like diabetes. The medical groups are paid a general large sum per period, for example, $30,000 per year from the $40,000 allocated to the insured individual. The medical group negotiates their cycle pay from the insurance companies and are in contract to be paid the said amount. </p>

              <p>Of course, patients would be able to exit the medical provider contract if pre-determined care requirements are not being met. if the patient is being neglected or quality decreases because of the incentive against the use of medical resources, the patient, like any consumer, can simply switch medical groups - one that provides either cheaper service or better quality care, or both.</p>

              <p>There are also financial incentives for patients to maintain good health. They would keep a percentage of the unused insurance package for their own use. Furthermore, they would have financial penalties for not following explicit protocols set by their care team.</p>
              <p>Creating a system with the proper market foundations and incentives is far from easy. Restructuring an entire system is a political and economic struggle. With today’s polarization against free enterprises, it’s be a challenge to move forces in the right direction. But, in a country of bold entrepreneurs, there is hope for innovating the business model of healthcare. With a small nucleus of insurance companies and medical group collaboration, it’s possible to show progress in the right direction.</p>
