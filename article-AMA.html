              <p><a id="ch1" class="section scrollspy"></a> American Medical Association (AMA) has gone from $34,000 annual revenue to amassing $16.5 million in profit in 2009 <sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20100607/MODERNPHYSICIAN/306079999">15</a></sup>, being the third largest lobbyist in the nation, and changing the destiny of American medicine. Today, the AMA is the strongest and most influential union in the U.S.<sup><a target="_blank" href=" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/how-the-ama-got-rich-powe_b_6103720.html">13</a></sup> It exercises immense control over the physician profession and influences the direction of medicine.</p>

              <p>As we explore in this article, the AMA's control and influence are detrimental to the prosperity of the medical profession and healthcare industry. Interestingly, a brief analysis is all that is needed to show that licensure restricts innovation and progress and is a tool abused for economic and political manipulation.</p>

              <p>The AMA's policies inherently restrict the supply of doctors, giving us the doctor shortage we experience today and expect to worsen in the near future. For it's own protection, the AMA resists innovation, contributing to the technological and managerial lag in healthcare today. Medical education is shackled by licensure exams that create learning environments of short-term memorizaiton. Finally, the AMA's control can be seen to affect the residency slot shortage, leaving hundreds of MD graduates without a training avenue.</p>

              <p>It's members may initially judge the AMA as looking for the doctors’ best interest, with priority in safety and quality of healthcare. However, looking beyond the surface we find a behemoth organization that is hurting healthcare and the physician career. There are viable alternatives that grant communities the quality and safety they desire in medicine, <a id="ch2"  class="section scrollspy">alternatives</a> that free the industry and profession to progress through innovation and competition.</p>

              <h4>Lowering Supply of Doctors</h4>

              <p>The AMA's origin can be traced back to a transformative change in power and ideology. An English-born, Nebraskan doctor, - Dr. George Simmons - in the year 1899, began his crusade that transformed the AMA into an aggressive, profit-driven organization. In less than a decade, the AMA quadrupled it's profit, and multiplied it's membership by nearly a factor of ten. How did an association achieve this? By establishing a firm foundation of using large pharmaceutical advertising, shutting down half of the country’s medical schools, and distributing media propaganda to shut out competition.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/how-the-ama-got-rich-powe_b_6103720.html">14</a></sup></p>

              <p>With the ability to license physicians, state laws that require a license, and sub-councils with power to approve medical schools for licensing, the AMA holds complete power to influence educational standards, number of schools, and number of admissions<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup>. Without question, the AMA has maintained the supply of doctors low.</p>

              <p>The AMA decreases total supply of doctors by lowering medical student admissions, and cutting the total number of medical schools and teaching hospitals.<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup> At it’s inception, the AMA decreased supply of doctors by almost 30% by declaring a surplus of “substandard doctors.”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/25/american-medical-association-opinions-columnists-shikha-dalmia.html">10</a></sup> It lobbied  congress to shut down medical schools that did not meet their arbitrary standards.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhpr033066">11</a></sup> No new medical schools reopened from 1910 to 1980, and only recently, amidst great pressure, have new medical schools been built and approved.</p>

              <p>What motive would the AMA have in maintaining the supply of doctors low and diligently controlling the practice of medicine? Like any other organization, the protection of the medical profession is a top priority. This goal includes protecting against competition and maintaining wages elevated.</p>

              <p>No clearer example exists than the Sherman Antitrust case ruled against the AMA in 1987. After 9 years of litigation and investigation, Judge Getzendanner ruled the AMA guilty of “systematic, long-term intent to destroy a licensed profession … labeling all chiropractors <a id="ch3" class="section scrollspy">unscientific</a> cultists and depriving chiropractors of association with medical physicians, injury to reputation was assured by the AMA’s name-calling practice.”<sup><a target="_blank" href=" http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/29/us/us-judge-finds-medical-group-conspired-against-chiropractors.html">12</a></sup> </p>


              <h4>Resistance to Innovation</h4>
              <p>The AMA consistently resists technological and managerial innovation in medicine. Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman writes, “The AMA has been consistently against the practice of group medicine, and against prepaid medical plans.”<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup> The power to approve hospitals and grant a supply of interns gives the AMA leverage to influence institutional behavior.<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup> Why would the AMA want to prevent innovation? Innovation takes industries down unpredictable paths often <a id="ch4" class="section scrollspy">changing</a> the balance of power and influence. The uncertainty is enough incentive for the AMA to act against innovation and preserve it's influence.</p>

              <h5 class="indent">i. AMA’s Fight Against Prepaid Plans</h5>

              <p>Prepaid plans are a threat to economic control. The plans allowed patients and physicians to establish a membership for medical services with a price as a function of factors like family size and age. Physicians groups competed for patients by offering services at lower prices.<sup><a href="#Reuben">2</a></sup> For example, a physician family practice may compete for patients from a neighboring practice by offering better price packages and quality of care. This normal market competition at work in medicine.</p>

              <p>Economics professor Reuben Kessel showed in “Price Discrimination in Medicine,” that the AMA behaved in monopolistic means by preventing physician group practices from offering pre-paid plans. Physician groups with any form of pre-paid plans were specially targeted through media attacks by labeling them unethical.<sup><a href="#Reuben">2</a></sup> The AMA preserved the ability to price differentiate -- or the ability to charge people differently <a id="ch5" class="section scrollspy">according</a> to their income -- allowing the business to extract a larger share of the value from the consumer and maintain high prices.</p>

              <h5 class="indent">ii. The Power of Innovation</h5>

              <p>Harvard Professor, Regina Herzlinger, in <a target="_blank" href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000WE2LEC&asin=B000WE2LEC&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_i3CVxb5B52RV5&tag=uncovermed-20">Who Killed Healthcare? America’s $2 Trillion Medical Problem – and the Consumer-driven Cure</a>, demonstrates the power of technological and managerial innovation to bring value to all parties involved in the healthcare transaction. The famous Shouldice Hospital in Toronto, Canada has innovated the managerial practice of surgical repair of hernias.<sup><a target="_blank" href="#Herzlinger">3</a></sup></p>
              <img src="assets/img/surgery.jpg" class="responsive-img img-right">
              <p>Through scaling of specialized services, the hospital has achieved remarkable results on quality and cost. They've lowered the recurrence rate of hernias from 15% to as little as 1%,  and decreased costs of the operation by about half!<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/product/Shouldice-Hospital-Limite/an/683068-PDF-ENG">4</a></sup></p>

              <p>Innovation doesn’t just benefit practices and patients, but also insurers. eHealthInsurance Services, Inc. is a for-profit company that has innovated on the diversity and number of plans offered, specially those that other health insurance companies refuse to offer. Bold innovation has led to the company's successful market valuation of more than half a billion dollars when going public in 2006.<sup><a href="#Herzlinger">3</a></sup></p>

              <p>Friedman argues the nature of licensure by the AMA eliminates incentives for disruptive experimentation. He proposes that, “it's difficult to engage in research and experimentation unless you are a member of the profession.”<sup><a href="#Reuben">2</a></sup> However, for physicians, the highest credential incentive is to remain in good standing <a id="ch6" class="section scrollspy">with</a> the AMA and that highly limits them to non-provocative scientific and managerial experimentation.<sup><a href="#Reuben">2</a></sup></p>

              <h4>Licensure Hurts Medical Education: The USMLE</h4>

              <p>The USMLE exams refocus medical education to test-taking. By nature, the exam reduces education of the brightest minds to mundane short-term memorization, leaving multidisciplinary problem-solving to extracurriculars<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/innovation-is-sweeping-through-u-s-medical-schools-1424145650">5</a></sup>. Medical schools are left with little time to devote to topics like practice management, public policy, public health, business, and leadership – topics that engage deep learning<sup><a href="#Sternberg">16</a></sup> and skills that promise to impact communities through innovation.</p>

              <p>Schools like the new Dell Medical School in Austin, Texas , the new Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hepstead, N.Y., and NYU School of Medicine are making big changes to their medical education. Some changes include more hands-on work in emergency technician roles, helping patients navigate the administrative process, and working with large data and technologies like electronic medical records.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/innovation-is-sweeping-through-u-s-medical-schools-1424145650">5</a></sup></p>
              <img src="assets/img/medical-school.jpeg"  class="responsive-img">
              <p>Medical schools are adjusting around the board exams, making leaps with progressive education. Regardless, their curriculum is crippled by the board exams that still require the students to memorize and spend months on practice tests and preparatory courses. Students interviewing at medical schools quickly realize that medical schools sell themselves on how well they prepare students for the <em>board exams</em>.</p>


              <h4><a id="ch7" class="section scrollspy">Maintaining Licensure</a></h4>

              <p>License renewal is yet another incessant hurdle. For doctors to renew their license, Maintenance of Licensure (MOL) requires up to 120 hours per year of Continuing Medical Education (CME) -- courses, lectures, tests, and more, all which vary from state-to-state and between specialties. Additionally, the AMA is now pursuing 2 more licensure continuation requirements -- Maintenance of Continuation (MOC) and Osteopathic Continuous Certification (OCC)<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/osteopathic-continuous-certification.aspx">6</a></sup> -- which are more learning requirements and assessments. Does this sound redundant, confusing, and costly? That’s because it truly is.</p>

              <p>Physicians themselves are protesting the expansion of regulation that burdens Doctors. Many agree that the MOC is “expensive, time-consuming, and unnecessary”, finding the self-evaluation modules a “waste of time, energy and money,” not benefiting from it and not improving patient care and safety. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons has sued the <a id="ch8"  class="section scrollspy">AMBS</a> alleging “restraint of trade” that limits patient access to doctors. Petitions by doctors have arisen for limiting the frequency of testing for licensure.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/abms/moc-examination-costs-and-impact-physicians">7</a></sup></p>

              <h4>A Residency Bottleneck</h4>

              <p>The impending shortage of physicians has sparked an increase in medical school admissions and the creation of new medical schools. A high-pressure bottleneck is looming as the number of resident positions remains constant while medical graduates increase. In 2015, 500 MD graduates from US medical schools were not matched to residency slots.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/266610-shortage-of-residency-slots-may-have-chilling-effect-on-next">9</a></sup></p>

              <p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 capped the number of residency slots the Medicare would fund. Any extra residents taken by a teaching hospital must be fully funded by the hospital itself. There is little incentive for hospitals or private practices to fund the training of residents. On the contrary, the incentives are at becoming an “approved” hospital to gain access to the cheap labor of interns and residents.<sup><a href="#Reuben">2</a></sup>  This is in <a id="ch9"  class="section scrollspy">contrast</a> to other occupations - like engineering -  that have paid and unpaid internship programs fully funded by the company or organization itself.</p>

              <h4>Why Limit Entrance and Exert Control?</h4>

              <p>A popular argument is that an “optimum” level of quality must be kept.<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup> It’s often believed that in cases of the health of people, there must be a governing body maintaining the highest possible quality of care. But, wouldn't maintaining a healthy basal minimum level of quality be more effective?</p>

              <p>Consider a hypothetical, in which the auto industry is regulated in the same manner as healthcare. Given that the auto industry decided to only allow car manufacturers to produce and sell cars that are up to the Cadillac standard, all vehicle drivers would be getting among the highest of qualities of vehicles.<sup><a href="#friedman">1</a></sup> Of course, only those able to afford the Cadillac would be able to have a vehicle and its form of transportation.</p>

              <p>We observe the same dilemma in healthcare and rationalize it in ways that make sense of the status quo. Millions go without access because of the high costs of care. The expectation of ultra-high quality is a contributor to our health economic crisis. However, I don't argue we must lower quality to increase access to care.</p>

              <p>There need not be compromise on cost and options of care, in the name of quality. As it has been shown in many industries and occupations, enterprises and individual professionals achieve remarkable high quality of products and services because of the incentive to protect or elevate their reputation and brand. With today’s tech world of infinitely fast information <a id="ch10"  class="section scrollspy">sharing</a> and brand rating, preserving a reputation and brand is a survival necessity for companies and professionals wanting to stay in business.</p>
              <h4> An Alternative Approach</h4>
              <p>The idea of eliminating the AMA's strict oversight of caregivers is daunting, considering the high risk nature of the profession. Given that minor mistakes can have serious consequences, maintaining a minimum level of quality must always be prioritized. So, how can we ensure high maintenance of the parameters that matter, without micromanaging the profession? </p>

              <p>First, let's consider the restaurant industry, the most competitive industry in the U.S. giving consumers diverse options of quality and price. The restaurant industry is transparent, in which consumers can easily browse options and prices and compare among restaurants.</p>

              <p> The FDA, Department of Health and other organizations tightly regulate the food industry, overseeing food handling, preparation and storage. The Health Department inspects restaurant sanitation and requires public display of letter grades <sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/why-these-3-restaurants-were-forced-to-shut-down.html/?a=viewall ">18</a></sup>. Although far from perfect, the FDA also ensures that the food industry has a certain degree of transparency for nutritional information to inform its consumers<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/fda-regulations-fast-food-64834.html">17</a></sup>.</p>

              <p> In Healthcare, it's possible to imagine similar regulation for safety in the back-end, without having to extensively micromanage. Beyond the current safety inspections on hospitals and clinics, safety departments could enforce the informing patients for the quality and price of the care they will choose. For example, hospitals, clinics and private practices would be required to explicitly display prices to patients. Another critical form of transparency is the clinical experience and outcomes of the institution.</p>

              <p>Oversight and regulation can exist without the micromanagement of licensing by AMA. A regulation similar to the restaurant industry will provide with a minimal, acceptable quality of <a id="ch11" class="section scrollspy">care</a>. Providers are then able to compete for patients by offering ®higher quality care and lower price. </p>

              <h4>Diverging Futures</h4>

              <p>The AMA hurts the healthcare economy by creating a shortage of doctors, decreasing supply of care, lowering accessibility to healthcare, decreasing technological and managerial innovation, suppressing competition, and increasing costs. The AMA also hurts doctors and is detrimental to the future of the physician discipline.</p>

              <p>The physician career will not flourish to its potential with the constrictions of the AMA. Education will continue to shackle doctors in debt and limit their educational potential by providing the wrong learning incentives in the form of impractical board exams. The AMA will proceed to confine physicians within the walls of traditions without freedoms of innovation and managerial experimentation.</p>

              <p>An incredible market incentive exists to replace doctors with artificially intelligent computers. Training a doctor is costly, requiring decades and hundreds of thousands of dollars. As trends have shown, technology will slowly replace physicians in attempts to eliminate the most costly asset of healthcare.</p>

              <p>Doctors, patients, communities, and organizations have the power to influence the direction of the future. A free market society has shown to value individuals who bring value through relevant expertise, abilities, and skills. Doctors will undoubtedly be valued, financially and reputably, outside the misleading protection of the AMA. The future of our healthcare depends on the actions of leaders inside and outside the profession, to lead a transformation in Medicine, beginning by eliminating the power and influence of the AMA.</p>
