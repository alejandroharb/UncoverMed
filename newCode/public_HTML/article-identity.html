      <p>I sat in my cap and gown, facing the rows of students ahead of me. The stadium was filled with families. To my right, my eyes meet the words being written in a small journal by another student whom I don’t know. He has written paragraphs, but my attention is drawn to, “everything’s messed up.” As is common in graduations, he had internal conflict. So did I.</p>

      <p>One week previously, I had sent an email to the medical schools that had offered me early admission. I had respectfully declined acceptance. I closed and locked the doors that my near-obsessive dedication had pried opened. I had so suddenly abandoned the identity I had arduously crafted over the years. Without a firm foundation of who I was, I felt astray.</p>

      <p>Becoming a Doctor often means tethering one's identity to their profession. Society’s divine regard for the physician is a seductive call to envelop our selves to the occupation. The pressure is ubiquitous. The incredibly rigorous premedical track and competitive admission process nearly necessitates the abandonment of other passions or interests even before entering medical education.</p>

      <p>The identity culture in Medicine is further emphasized during medical school. In my interview at UTMB, a physician professor and admission officer stood before 30 interviewing students delivering the unambiguous message that, “becoming a doctor means upholding the name in all aspects of our lives, living with dignity and proper conduct, even in our communities beyond the walls of the clinic.” This was a clear call to begin building an identity around our career, if we hadn't already done so.</p>
      <p>Imagine a scenario. You’ve diligently studied all undergraduate years as a premedical student: took the MCAT and completed the infinite requirements to be a competitive applicant. Then, medical school requires ten-fold the work and dedication, with even more stress to pass the board exams, do research, and excel during clinical rounds. Finally, as a resident, the labor only intensifies as you’re overworked, lack adequate sleep for years, and have to study for the final board exam.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t taken a break, you’re finishing residency and fellowship in your early 30’s. You’ve dedicated your early life to your dream job. You have family, friends, and colleagues that have narrowed down you’re existence to the constricting walls of the “MD” title. You are defined by what you do.</p>
      <img src="assets/img/doctor-lg.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="doctor in clinic">
      <p>There is no surprise when doctors (and occupations like scientists) take a professional failure deeply personal. Losing a big malpractice suit, and having it <a href="http://web.docinfo.org/#/search/query">broadcasted online</a> <em>must</em> be devastating. Even more, losing one’s license is akin to existential death. What defined her as a person no longer exists.</p>

      <h2>Origins: An Evolutionary and Social Construct</h2>
      <p>We don’t often pay enough attention to our identity. It’s a natural tendency. The brain cognitively formulates a self that conforms to our most important groups and communities.<sup><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/782/docs/handbook_of_self_and_identity_-_second_edition_-_ch._4_pp._69-104_38_pages.pdf">3</a></sup> Through evolution of our prefrontal cortex, we’ve come to naturally construct an ego and an identity.</p>

      <p>They <em>way</em> we define our identity is a social construct, however. Tribal behavior drives us to craft an identity that grants value and importance within society.<sup><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/782/docs/handbook_of_self_and_identity_-_second_edition_-_ch._4_pp._69-104_38_pages.pdf">3</a></sup> In Latin America, identity is closely tied to social relationships like family and friends<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> while eastern asian cultures often construct identities based strictly on family.</p>

      <p>Tying our identity to our profession is a part of western culture. We seek to learn about people by the common status question, “what do you do?” We subconsciously judge lazy the people without professional passions or ambitions. Our biggest social icons are the professional elite: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, or Jeff Bezos. We, as a society, choose to place the upmost value on our occupation.</p>

      <h2>Unexpected Consequences</h2>
      <p>An identity is a double-edged sword. How we envision ourselves, in the present and in the future, can be a source of inspiration and motivation <sup><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/782/docs/handbook_of_self_and_identity_-_second_edition_-_ch._4_pp._69-104_38_pages.pdf">3</a></sup>. Students and professionals remind themselves of their future titles as MD’s or CEO’s to overcome challenging obstacles and to delay gratification. However, a career-focused identity can be detrimental to our psychological wellbeing.</p>

      <p>Concentrating our identity in our profession is unhealthy. When we attach our identity to our work, our worth is at the mercy of forces out of our control. For example, economic conditions may require lay-offs at our workplace. Similarly, a  biased authority may hold the power to choose the chief resident.</p>
      <p><b>Failure</b> becomes a personal crisis rendering us anxious and emotionally unstable. We are less likely to take chances and be bold in our career because failure would define us as incompetent and incapable. Resiliency is more difficult because the failures are emotionally consuming. A constant in life is that failure is guaranteed to meet us in merciless fashions.</p>
      <p>Defining ourselves through our profession hurts us. Any professional failure is a shot at our worth. We are perpetually at the mercy of forces outside of our control. By allowing our ego to guide our decisions, we take fewer chances because we’re emotionally unstable and anxious at uncertainty. We are less creative, decisive, and effective in our lives.</p>
      <h3>Mental Health</h3>
      <p>Depression is an epidemic in America and rampant in the medical profession. Medicine has among the highest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298348473_Suicide_rates_among_physicians_a_quantitative_and_gender_assessment_meta-analysis">suicide rates</a> of its students and professionals, when compared to all other professions. Likewise, depression is widely spread across specializations.</p>
      <p>As a student, I attended a meeting for a physician organization when they discovered a community doctor had taken his life after a devastating malpractice loss. More personally, my father – a respected anesthesiologist – died of a “miscalculated” dose to an anesthetic. Family rationalized it was meant to help with sleep. </p>

      <h2>Change: A Counterintuitive Approach</h2>
      <p>Relinquishing a firm identity may be among the most effective ways to achieve balance and tranquility. Research shows that placing lower importance on the identity we construct results in higher wellbeing because we're less affected by forces that threaten our identity.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19050334">study</a> of individuals with multiple identities revealed that the importance placed on their identities determined wellbeing. When identities were considered important by the patient, having harmony between the multiple identities resulted in greater psychological wellbeing. If the identities were in conflict with each other, then wellbeing suffered greatly. Alternatively, the relationships between the identities had little to no effect on wellbeing if the identities were not considered important to the patient.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> In other words, the multiple personality patients that held their <strong>identities with low importance were less likely to experience negative psychological effects, and be more emotionally stable.</strong></p>
      <p>Consider Buddhism and meditation. Buddhist practice considers identity to be fluid or nonexistent. Meditation is the focus on accepting and rendering to the present moment. To do so means to authentically strip away our mental weight and accepting the external world. The Buddha believed that we achieve internal peace and tranquility when we abandon social and mental constructs of social status and identity.</p>
      <img src="assets/img/contemplation.jpeg" class="img-responsive">
      <p>Life is enjoyed more when we rid ourselves of the weight of our identity. If you must define yourself, choose an internal metric that grants ownership of your life. In medicine, students and professionals can make conscious efforts to avoid the identity trap.</p>
      <h3>Work Culture</h3>
      <p>Educational institutions and organizations in medicine must consider the situation in which they place their students and employees. Companies are getting a competitive edge by attracting and keeping the best talent and hardest workers. They create an environment of empathy and cooperation that reinforces a healthy workplace. Giving people the opportunity to have a life or passion outside of work is an important ingredient to a thriving environment. </p>
      <p>The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has transformed <a href="http://fortune.com/best-companies/the-boston-consulting-group-3/">work-life balance</a> in an industry famous for burnout. With the help of Harvard professor, Leslie Perlow, BCG has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-krentz/zeroing-in-on-the-work-in-work-life-balance_b_6492494.html">instituted</a> the PTO (Predictability, Teaming and Open Communication) program that establishes the most predictable aspects of the job for each individual, creates stable teams, and fosters a practice of open communication. Employees formulate times at which they are offline from work. In teams, they systematically coordinate time off between team-members for emergencies, family time, or vacation. BCG’s $100 million investment over 10 years is an example organizations rightfully investing in the wellbeing of their people.</p>
      <h2>Take-away</h2>
      <p>As humans beings, we are truly great at walking toward unhappiness. There is no one to blame but ourselves. At any moment, we have the choice to take a step back to assess our actions and make changes. Every day we are presented with the opportunity to grow.</p>
      <p>Paul Graham said, "keep your identity small." Don’t give in to the temptation to live by dogma of a great title. Avoid the pitfall of egotistical ambition, a drive based on a need for validation. Rather, choose an internal metric by which to live life. Characteristics like curiosity, experimentation, purpose, and love are long-lasting. They stand the test of failure and trials. Most importantly, they are within our control.</p>
